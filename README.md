Automate Client Onboarding with GPT-4o, GoHighLevel, Google Drive, Slack, and Gmail

# Automate Client Onboarding with GPT-4o, GoHighLevel, Google Drive, Slack, and Gmail

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow automates the client onboarding process by integrating multiple services: GPT-4o (OpenAI), GoHighLevel CRM, Google Drive, Slack, and Gmail. Its goal is to process client form submissions, generate segmented onboarding tasks via AI, organize client data and documents in Google Drive, create communication channels in Slack, update or create CRM contacts, assign tasks, and send personalized welcome emails.

The workflow is logically divided into the following blocks:

- **1.1 Input Reception and Initial Processing:** Receives client data via form submission, extracts and renames files.
- **1.2 Client Folder and Contact Setup:** Creates a main client folder in Google Drive and updates/creates the client contact in GoHighLevel.
- **1.3 AI Task Segmentation:** Uses OpenAI GPT-4o to parse input and segment onboarding tasks with structured output parsing.
- **1.4 Task Loop and Execution:** Loops over segmented tasks to create Slack channels, post messages, and create tasks in GoHighLevel.
- **1.5 Notification and Welcome Email:** Posts messages in Slack channels and sends a welcome email to the client.
